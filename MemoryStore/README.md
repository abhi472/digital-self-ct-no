# 🧠 DigitalSelf MemoryStore – README Guide

Welcome to your DigitalSelf architecture. This guide explains how to restart a session, avoid loss of continuity, and maintain memory across evolving AI conversations.

## ✅ What’s Inside the ZIP

### 📁 `core_gpt/memory_log.md`
Tracks the main narrative of your AI journey.
- Log each session: goals, mindset, results.
- In a new session, just paste the last summary into ChatGPT.

### 📁 `core_gpt/token_tracker.json`
Tracks token usage to help avoid the CT-NO (Context Token – No Overlap) event.
- Manually update after each session.
- Use it to decide when to archive logs or split personas.

### 📁 `personas/example_persona/`
Template folder to create separate personas.
- Each persona will have its own memory file and log.
- Respect boundaries between "you", coworkers, teachers, and assistants.

### 📁 `backups/`
Use this to store zipped snapshots of the memory store.
- Take backups weekly or after any major milestone.

## 🔁 Restarting a Session – Manual Memory Reload

If ChatGPT has lost memory from a previous session:
1. Open your latest `memory_log.md` entry.
2. Copy the **summary** and token count.
3. Say:  
   `“Load from DigitalSelf core memory log. Last session summary: [your text]. Token count: [your value].”`

ChatGPT will simulate continuity using this external memory.

## 💾 Backup Strategy
- Backup this entire folder regularly.
- Store in Google Drive, Dropbox, or Git repo for versioning.

---

## 🧪 Advanced Ideas (Optional)
- Automate updates using Python or Obsidian plugins.
- Build a frontend to manage logs and personas visually.
- Token limits: Track usage to stay under 100k context tokens.

## 📌 Reminder
This file and structure form your “Digital Brain Core.” It is designed to survive model resets, session drops, or migrations to other AI systems.

Stay deliberate. Stay structured. This is your foundation.
