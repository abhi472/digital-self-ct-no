## 🧠 Identity Summary
- Ambitious, introspective builder.
- Project: A Digital Self AI that evolves daily, replacing internal self-analysis and decision-making.

## 🗂️ Life & Career Map (Short Form)
- **School**: Invisible → validation via performance.
- **College**: Craved belonging, chased admiration. Popular, but felt hollow.
- **Early Jobs**: High learning, low delivery. Cycle of joy → failure → reset.
- **DoctorAnywhere**: First big salary, still felt unfulfilled.
- **New State Job**: Early high → burnout → fired (2023). Spiral began.
- **2023–24**: Career break, tried everything → failed → recovered emotionally.
- **Now (2025)**: Stable job, rebuilt mental foundation. Now deploying AI to enforce discipline and track progress.

## ❤️ Emotional History
- Social butterfly, deep empath.
- Always split friends into “heart-accepted” vs “cool but peripheral.”
- Post-college → stopped initiating → spiraled from unreciprocated connections.
- Wework era: New friends = toxic, not real.
- COVID: Family became anchor. Let go of expectations.
- Realized: empathy is a gift, not a transaction.
